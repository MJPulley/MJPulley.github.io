# INST 377 Final Project - Group 20 - PG County Speed Cameras
GitHub Pages Link: https://mjpulley.github.io/PGCountySpeedCameras/

## Target Browsers
For our application, we implemented elements within it so that users have the ability to access and interact with this site through their web browser for all devices, whether that be iOS, Android, etc. This application is geared towards being used on the Google Chrome web browser.

## API Source
Website: https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Community/Speed-Cameras/mnkf-cu5c
JSON: https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/mnkf-cu5c.json

## Visualizations
On the applications' home page, an interactive map of PG County is present. We utilized Leaflet.JS into our project in order to incorporate and display this specific map and visualize our data. As well as the map of PG County, we also included images of the PG County logo on the home page, as well as the about page, and implemented an image of PG County and its' regions on the home page.

## CSS Frameworks
We did not utlize specific frameworks or libraries for the styling aspects of our project. Instead, we used techniques that we learned through the course labs and resources. We felt that this most the best option in order to effectively display our data, as we were confident implementing the appraoches we have learned previosly throughout the course.

## What is our project trying to display and solve?
Our project is designed to display the specific locations of speed cameras, so that road users of PG County are aware of where they are located at in order to heed them, respect speed limits, and take other important driving laws into account. This is to help create a safe driving space for everyone that resides in PG County, and to assist in avoiding unwanted speed tickets.
