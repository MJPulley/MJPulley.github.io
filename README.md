# Group 20 Final Project Speed Cameras
GitHub Pages Link: https://mjpulley.github.io/PGCountySpeedCameras/

Our project is “PG County Speed Cameras” targeted towards macOS version 11 and, as those were the computers it was built on. 

We used the Prince George’s County OpenData API (https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/). 

Our project utilizes visualizations such as a a map and map markers using the Leaflet library, and a regional color-map of the PG county area. 

Our project is trying to fill the knowledge gaps between everyday drivers and where the speed cameras are located in the county. Having a display of speed camera locations accessible by location closes that gap.
